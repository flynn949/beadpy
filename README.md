Click on the BeadAnalysis.ipynb file to see what it can do.

After installing beadpy the normal usage is to proceed through the steps of the pipeline in the beadanalysis.ipnb Jupyter Notebook file.

It is recommended to install Anaconda and Python 3.x. Then use conda to install numba and ipyparallel to take advantage of just in time compilation and parallel processing. You will also need to install trackpy for bead tracking.
